## Overview

---

There are five main pages in the application; the process list page, the process page, the task list page, the employee list page, and the tags list page. Each list page can be accessed from the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. By default, the application will open the process list page.

---

## Process List Page

On the process list page, the user can add a new process, giving it a name and, optionally, a description. Once a process has been added, the user can click on a process item in the process list page to access the process' page.

---

## Process Page

On the process page, the user will see visualization of the tasks associated with the process and the flow of those tasks. Newly created processes don't have any tasks associated with them, so the user must create some tasks. The user can click on the plus icon to the right of a process or task node to add a new task connected to that node.
When creating a new task, the user must enter a name and, optionally, a description.

## Task List Page

On this page, you can see every current task related to every process. You can search and filter to find a specific one using the search bar and even edit or delete them.

## Task Detail Page

In the task detail popup, you can either edit or remove the task. Clicking edit will bring up an additional popup where you can assign its name, description, department and any related skills.
