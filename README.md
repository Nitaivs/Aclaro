# Welcome 

This Gitlab by LRZ project is here to be utilized for **completely managing your SCRUM project**.

So, you will use it 
- to create and update your **product backlog** with epics and user stories (=gitlab issues) 
- to agree on and maintain your **sprint backlog for each sprint** 
- update the **user stories and tasks within a sprint**  
  
For some hints on SCRUM in Gitlab see section further below.

Additionally, you document your project in the **Wiki of this Gitlab project** (see menu item `Plan` on the left and then `Wiki`).
This includes 
- to define your **DoD** (Definition of Done)
- to document your **sprint goal and backlog** per sprint 
- to prepare an **sprint review agenda** for each sprint and
- to record the created and presented **documents** of sprint

With finishing your project you will **hand in all required deliverables for grading** via this Gitlab project.
